Cloud Migration Project README

This README document provides an overview of a cloud migration project using Terraform. It outlines the goals, requirements, and steps involved in migrating an application to the cloud using Terraform.
Overview

The objective of this project is to migrate an existing application to the cloud using Terraform. The application is currently running on-premises and needs to be moved to a cloud infrastructure. The cloud infrastructure will be provisioned using Terraform, which will automate the infrastructure deployment process.
Requirements

The following are the requirements for the cloud migration project:

    The application must be migrated to the cloud with minimal downtime.
    The cloud infrastructure must be scalable and highly available.
    The infrastructure deployment process must be automated using Terraform.
    The infrastructure must be deployed in a cost-effective manner.
    The infrastructure must meet security and compliance requirements.

Architecture

The following is the high-level architecture for the cloud infrastructure:

    The infrastructure will be deployed in a single AWS region.
    The application will be deployed in an autoscaling group behind a load balancer.
    The database will be deployed in a separate subnet and accessed via a NAT gateway.
    The infrastructure will be deployed using Terraform.

Steps

The following are the steps involved in the cloud migration project:

    Identify the required resources and services in AWS for the application.
    Create a Terraform configuration file for the infrastructure.
    Provision the infrastructure using Terraform.
    Test the application in the cloud environment.
    Modify the DNS records to point to the new cloud environment.
    Monitor and optimize the infrastructure.

Conclusion

The cloud migration project using Terraform provides an automated way to deploy infrastructure in the cloud. With the help of Terraform, we can deploy infrastructure that is scalable, highly available, and cost-effective. By following the steps outlined in this README, we can successfully migrate an application to the cloud.
